## Description

In this repo, we'll find the correlation between years of potential life lost (YPLL) and some additional measures, such as age, gender, income or HIV rate. 

#### Years of potential life lost (YPLL)
YPLL is an early mortality measure. It measures, across 10.000 people, total number of years below the age of 75 a 10.000-people group loses. For example, if a person dies at 73, he contributes 2 years to this sum, while another guy dies at 78, he contributes 0 years to the sum.
The file **ypll.csv** contains per-county YPLLs for the U.S. in 2011
